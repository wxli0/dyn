    The marker used for imaging is a GFP tagged marker of F-actin markers.

    Notes
    -----
    There are 25 images (frames) per .tif video.
    There are 16 videos (trajectories).

    In each movie, there is a group of cells called the "border cell cluster", i.e.
    a tightly packed group of 5-7 cells that coordinate their movement as they move.
    They look (and in many ways behave) as a single cell. They move within
    a large structure, the egg chamber: we say that they "migrate".

    At some point in their migration, the cluster shows has a "lead protrusion"
    and sometimes the cluster is compact and lack this protrusion.

    The movies from this dataset, i.e. labeled 33623, 59080, and 104438 are actually of
    single cells (one cell within the cluster) or sometimes two cells in the cluster
    labeled with the rest of the cells in the cluster being dark.

    The movies labeled "33623" represents the control case, and shows a single cell as
    the rest of the cells in the cluster are dark.

    The movies labeled "59080" and "104438" correspond to knockdowns of proteins,
    where we anticipate the following shape changes:
    - cells less cohesive,
    - producing very small thin protrusions.

    """Find sign of angle to rotate cell about.

    This function tells us whether the angle that _septin_rotation_angle returns
    is a positive angle or a negative angle. We need this function because the
    arccos function that we use to find the magnitude of the angle only returns
    positive values, which means that the "_septin_align" fucntion will not know
    whether it needs to rotate the cell to the left or to the right in order to
    align the dot with the left side of the image frame.

    Thus, we use the cross product of the two vectors to determine whether the
    angle between left_vector and circle_vector is positive (i.e. the curve must be
    rotated counter clockwise in order to align the dot with the left edge) or
    negative (i.e. the curve must be rotated clockwise).

    If the z component of the cross product between these two vectors is negative,
    that means that the angle is positive.
    if the z component of the cross product between these two vectors is positive,
    that means that the angle is negative.

    Input vectors:
    --------------
    left_vector: 2D vector. tells us the location of the point that we are rotating
    the cell to
    circle_vector: 2D vector. tells us the location of the dot. i.e. the location
    of the part of
    the cell that we want to end up at the left side of the image.

    positive: tells whether the angle from the dot to the left point is positive or not.
