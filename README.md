The following three notebooks consists of the implementation for three tasks for DUNN/DLM8 cell lines.

- [explore_quantitle.ipynb](https://github.com/wxli0/dyn/blob/main/dyn/notebooks/explore_quantitle.ipynb): Visualization of different quantiles

- [explore_histogram.ipynb](https://github.com/wxli0/dyn/blob/main/dyn/notebooks/explore_histogram.ipynb): Histogram of distances to the mean

- [explore_dimension_reduction.ipynb](https://github.com/wxli0/dyn/blob/main/dyn/notebooks/explore_dimension_reduction.ipynb): Dimensionality reduction

[GSI2023_SI.pdf](https://github.com/wxli0/dyn/blob/main/dyn/manuscript/GSI2023_SI.pdf) contains supplementary figures to our main manuscript, showing results of our study on the DLM8 cell line and additional results for the DUNN cell line.
